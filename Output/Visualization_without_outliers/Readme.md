# Visualizations without Outliers

This folder contains visualizations created after removing outliers from the dataset. Outliers can sometimes distort the interpretation of key trends and metrics. This folder focuses on clean, normal distributions of data to provide more consistent and reliable insights.

## Contents:
- **Charts and Graphs**: Various visualizations of the e-commerce sales data, with outliers excluded. These plots are intended to represent typical sales behavior, customer actions, and product performance without the influence of extreme values.
- **Outlier Removal**: Outliers have been removed from the data before generating the visualizations to ensure a clearer representation of general trends.

## Example Visualizations:
1. **Sales Distribution Without Outliers**: A cleaner distribution chart of total sales where extreme values are excluded, showing more typical sales patterns.
2. **Customer Purchase Behavior Without Outliers**: An analysis of customer behavior with outliers removed to show normal purchase frequency and quantities.
3. **Top Products Without Outliers**: Displays the top-selling products, with outliers excluded to provide a more realistic picture of product performance.

## Why Remove Outliers?
- Outliers can distort trends and lead to inaccurate conclusions. For example, a few high-value customers or a few massive sales might make it appear that the company’s average sales are much higher than they really are.
- By removing these outliers, we ensure the analysis reflects the typical customer experience and sales patterns, which is valuable for strategic decision-making.

## Notes:
- Removing outliers can provide a more accurate representation of your data, particularly when the focus is on normal behavior or when making predictions for typical sales performance.
- However, it’s important to recognize that outliers might also indicate opportunities or issues that warrant further investigation.
