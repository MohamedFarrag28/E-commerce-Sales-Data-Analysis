# Visualizations with Outliers

This folder contains visualizations that include outliers in the data. Outliers are data points that differ significantly from other observations and can sometimes provide important insights, but they can also skew analysis. This folder aims to showcase the raw data with all anomalies or outliers included.

## Contents:
- **Charts and Graphs**: Various visualizations of the e-commerce sales data that highlight trends, customer behaviors, and product performance.
- **Outlier Identification**: Outliers in sales, order quantities, or customer behavior have been preserved to provide insights into unusual patterns or data anomalies.

## Example Visualizations:
1. **Sales Distribution with Outliers**: Shows the total sales distribution where outliers in sales figures are included.
2. **Customer Purchase Behavior with Outliers**: Visualizes customer purchase frequency and quantity, with outliers (e.g., extremely high-value customers) included.
3. **Top Products with Outliers**: Displays a bar chart showing top-selling products, including anomalies that skew total sales figures.

## Why Include Outliers?
- Outliers can highlight potential opportunities, such as identifying large, one-off purchases or irregular spikes in sales that could represent marketing campaign success or errors.
- This can help businesses understand both the normal trends and the exceptional cases that could either indicate success or require investigation.

## Notes:
- Some charts may look skewed due to the presence of extreme values (outliers), but this helps to reflect the real-world scenarios where unexpected or rare transactions occur.
