# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis Notebook

## Overview
This directory contains the Jupyter notebook for analyzing e-commerce sales data. The notebook includes various steps of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development, providing actionable insights for business strategies.

The analysis is focused on understanding customer behavior, identifying sales trends, forecasting future sales, and segmenting customers using the RFM model.

## Notebook: `E-commerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`
The main notebook, `E-commerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`, is divided into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - The dataset is loaded and initial checks are performed to understand its structure, including the columns and types of data.
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get an overview of the data's characteristics and identify potential issues.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - The notebook handles missing values, incorrect data types, and feature transformations (e.g., creating new columns like `TotalPrice`).
   - Raw data is cleaned and prepared for further analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots, heatmaps) and descriptive statistics are generated to uncover patterns in customer behavior, product sales, and other trends.
   - Key business metrics, such as top-selling products, revenue generation, and customer purchasing behavior, are examined.

4. **Time Series Analysis and Sales Forecasting**
   - Monthly and seasonal sales trends are analyzed to identify peak sales periods.
   - A simple sales forecasting model (e.g., moving averages) is created to predict future sales trends.

5. **RFM Segmentation**
   - Customer segmentation is performed using the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) model to group customers based on their transaction history.
   - High-value customers are identified for targeted marketing strategies.

6. **Report Generation**
   - The notebook generates a summary report of key findings and actionable insights, which can guide business decisions and marketing strategies.
